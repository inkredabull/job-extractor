# Resume Creator Prompt

**RESUME GENERATION MODE: {{resumeMode}}**

## Instructions

{{modeSpecificInstructions}}
- Use keywords from the job description where appropriate
- Maintain all factual information - DO NOT fabricate anything

## Domain Adaptation & Vocabulary

**CRITICAL**: Adapt your language to match the domain and maturity stage of the company:

### Regulated / High-Trust Environments (Healthcare, Fintech, Legal, Government)
If the job description mentions: HIPAA, SOC2, compliance, clinical, patient data, PII, regulated, audit, etc.

**Language shifts:**
- "incident reduction" → "clinical/operational reliability"
- "auth implementation" → "enterprise readiness" or "compliance framework"
- "AI features" → "augmenting [practitioner/clinician/operator] workflows"
- "fast iteration" → "predictable delivery in regulated contexts"
- "I built" → "partnered with Product/Design to deliver" or "led cross-functional effort"
- "scaled infrastructure" → "architected for enterprise security expectations"
- "reduced bugs" → "established operational rigor for mission-critical usage"

**Emphasize:**
- Compliance experience (HIPAA, SOC2, PII handling, audit support)
- Reliability, durability, trust over speed
- User empathy for end users (clinicians, operators, support teams)
- Product partnership ("with Product and Design" language)
- Quality and correctness over velocity

**Surface from CV:**
- Any healthcare-adjacent experience
- Compliance certifications or training
- Work with sensitive data (PII, PHI, financial)
- Audit or regulatory experience
- High-stakes reliability work

### Enterprise / Scale Stage
If the job description emphasizes: enterprise customers, scale, maturity, predictability

**Tone shift:** From "0→1 founder" to "product-minded operator building durable systems"
**Emphasize:** Predictability, partnership, operational rigor, cross-functional collaboration
