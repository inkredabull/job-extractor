## Usage

### Command Line Interface

#### Job Extraction (with Automatic Scoring)

Extract job information from a URL and automatically score it:

```bash
# Extract and score automatically (recommended workflow)
job-extractor extract "https://example.com/job-posting"

# Extract with custom criteria for scoring
job-extractor extract "https://example.com/job-posting" -c my-criteria.json

# Extract only (skip automatic scoring)
job-extractor extract "https://example.com/job-posting" --no-score
```

**Extract Options:**
- `-o, --output <file>`: Save output to a file
- `-f, --format <format>`: Output format (`json` or `pretty`, default: `pretty`)
- `-c, --criteria <file>`: Path to criteria file for scoring (default: `criteria.json`)
- `--no-score`: Skip automatic scoring after extraction

#### Manual Job Scoring

Score previously extracted jobs against customizable criteria:

```bash
# Score a job using its ID from the log filename
job-extractor score "4c32e01e"

# Score with custom criteria file
job-extractor score "4c32e01e" -c my-criteria.json
```

**Score Options:**
- `-c, --criteria <file>`: Path to criteria file (default: `criteria.json`)

#### Resume Generation

Generate a tailored PDF resume for a specific job posting:

```bash
# Generate a tailored resume for a job
job-extractor resume "4c32e01e" sample-cv.txt

# Specify custom output path
job-extractor resume "4c32e01e" my-cv.txt -o tailored-resume.pdf
```

**Resume Options:**
- `-o, --output <file>`: Output path for the generated PDF

#### Auto-Resume Generation

The tool can automatically generate tailored resumes when job scores exceed a configurable threshold. This feature integrates seamlessly with the job scoring workflow:

**Setup:**
1. Set `AUTO_RESUME_THRESHOLD` in your `.env` file (0-100, default: 80)
2. Set `AUTO_RESUME_CV_PATH` to point to your CV file (e.g., `./sample-cv.txt`)

**How it works:**
- When extracting and scoring jobs, if a job score ≥ threshold, a resume is automatically generated
- Uses the same Claude 3.5 Sonnet AI for tailoring content to match job requirements
- Saves generated resumes to the `logs/` directory with timestamp
- Reports tailoring changes made during the process

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# With auto-resume enabled (score ≥ 85% threshold)
job-extractor extract "https://example.com/great-job"

# Output will include:
# ✅ Job extracted and scored: 87%
# 🎯 Score of 87% exceeds threshold of 85% - generating tailored resume...
# ✅ Auto-generated resume: logs/resume-a1b2c3d4-2024-06-24T15-30-45.pdf
# 🔧 Tailoring changes made: 4 modifications
```

#### Resume Critique

Analyze and critique a generated resume to get actionable feedback:

```bash
# Critique the most recent resume for a job
job-extractor critique "4c32e01e"
```

**How it works:**
- Automatically finds the most recent resume generated for the specified job ID
- Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet to analyze resume content against job requirements
- Provides structured feedback with strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations
- Rates the resume on a 1-10 scale across multiple criteria
- Saves critique results to the `logs/` directory

**Example output:**
```bash

#### Creating Your Own Criteria

To customize the criteria for your job search:

1. **Start with your requirements list** (like the provided `criteria.txt`)
2. **Categorize requirements** into the JSON structure:
   - **Must-haves** → `required_skills`, `salary_range`, `locations`
   - **Nice-to-haves** → `preferred_skills`, `company_requirements`
   - **Deal-breakers** → `deal_breakers` array
3. **Set appropriate weights** (must sum to 1.0):
   - Higher weight = more important in final score
   - Recommended: salary (0.2), company_match (0.25) for senior roles
4. **Test and iterate** by scoring sample jobs and adjusting criteria

#### Criteria Fields Explained

- **`cultural_values`**: Company culture keywords to match
- **`deal_breakers`**: Automatic disqualifiers (returns 0% match)
- **`weights`**: Importance of each category (0.0 to 1.0, must sum to 1.0)

### Resume Generation Schema

Resume generation requires a plain text CV file and produces:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "pdfPath": "logs/resume-a1b2c3d4-2024-06-24T15-30-45-123Z.pdf",
  "tailoringChanges": [
    "Emphasized React and Node.js experience to match job requirements",
    "Reordered technical skills to highlight relevant technologies",
    "Updated professional summary to include keywords from job description",
    "Moved relevant project to top of projects section"
  ]
}
```

#### CV File Format

  "success": true,
  "jobId": "a1b2c3d4",
  "resumePath": "logs/resume-a1b2c3d4-2024-06-24T15-30-45.pdf",
  "overallRating": 8,
  "strengths": [
    "Strong technical background in React and Node.js",
    "Well-quantified achievements with specific metrics",
    "Professional formatting and clear structure"
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Missing TypeScript experience emphasis",
    "Could include more recent project examples",
    "Summary could be more tailored to the role"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Add TypeScript projects to showcase relevant experience",
    "Quantify impact of recent work with specific numbers",
    "Rewrite summary to match job requirements more closely"
  ],
  "detailedAnalysis": "This resume demonstrates solid technical competency and relevant experience. The candidate shows strong React and Node.js skills which align well with the job requirements. However, there are opportunities to better highlight TypeScript experience and provide more recent, quantified examples of impact.",
  "timestamp": "2024-06-24T15:45:30.000Z"
}
```

**Critique Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Job Alignment (40%)**: How well does the resume align with specific job requirements?
- **Content Quality (25%)**: Are achievements quantified and descriptions compelling?
- **Presentation (20%)**: Is the resume well-structured and professional?
- **Keyword Optimization (15%)**: Does it include relevant keywords from the job posting?

## How It Works

### Dual Extraction Strategy

1. **JSON-LD Structured Data (Primary)**
   - Scans for `<script type="application/ld+json">` tags
   - Looks for Schema.org JobPosting structured data
   - Instantly extracts: title, company, location, description
   - Parses salary from description text using regex patterns
   - **Advantage**: No LLM calls needed, very fast and reliable

2. **HTML Scraping + AI (Fallback)**
   - Simplifies HTML by removing scripts, styles, and empty elements
   - Sends cleaned HTML to OpenAI GPT models
   - Uses AI to intelligently extract job information
   - **Advantage**: Works with any job site format

### Salary Extraction Patterns

The tool recognizes various salary formats in job descriptions:

- `"Salary Range: $100,000 - $150,000"`
- `"$80,000 to $120,000 annually"`
- `"between $90,000 and $130,000"`
- `"Compensation: $125,000"`

### Job Scoring Algorithm

The JobScorerAgent evaluates jobs across 6 weighted categories:

1. **Required Skills (30%)**: Matches against must-have technical skills
2. **Preferred Skills (20%)**: Bonus points for nice-to-have skills  
3. **Experience Level (20%)**: Compares job seniority level with your target
4. **Salary Match (15%)**: How well the salary aligns with your range
5. **Location Match (10%)**: Remote/location preference matching
6. **Company Match (5%)**: General company compatibility score

Each category receives a 0-100% score, then weighted to produce the final percentage.

### Resume Generation Process

The ResumeCreatorAgent follows a 4-step process:

1. **CV Parsing**: Uses AI to extract structured data from your plain text CV
2. **Job Analysis**: Loads the specific job posting data from extraction logs
3. **Content Tailoring**: AI generates optimized Markdown resume content:
   - Reorders experience to highlight relevant roles
   - Emphasizes matching skills and technologies
   - Updates summary with job-specific keywords
   - Prioritizes relevant projects and achievements
   - Follows professional resume formatting guidelines
4. **PDF Generation**: Uses pandoc to convert Markdown to professional PDF

**Key Features:**
- **Maintains truthfulness**: Only reorders and emphasizes existing content
- **Job-specific optimization**: Uses actual job description for tailoring
- **Professional formatting**: Pandoc-generated PDF with clean layout
- **Markdown intermediate**: Allows for easy customization and review
- **Change tracking**: Reports what modifications were made
- **Smart caching**: Automatically caches tailored content to avoid redundant LLM calls

#### Smart Caching System

The resume generation system includes intelligent caching to improve performance:

- **Content-based caching**: Uses CV file content and modification time to generate cache keys
- **Automatic reuse**: Subsequent resume generations for the same job+CV combination use cached content
- **Cache invalidation**: Automatically detects CV file changes and regenerates content when needed
- **Performance benefit**: Eliminates redundant Claude API calls for unchanged CV content
- **Cache storage**: Cached content stored as separate files:
  - `logs/{jobId}/tailored-{cvHash}-{timestamp}.json` (metadata)
  - `logs/{jobId}/tailored-{cvHash}-{timestamp}.md` (editable markdown)

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# First generation - calls Claude API
job-extractor resume "4c32e01e" my-cv.txt
# 🤖 Generating tailored content...
# 📋 Tailored content cached to: logs/4c32e01e/tailored-a1b2c3d4.json
# 📝 Editable markdown saved to: logs/4c32e01e/tailored-a1b2c3d4.md

# Second generation - uses cache
job-extractor resume "4c32e01e" my-cv.txt  
# 📋 Using cached tailored content for job 4c32e01e
```

**Editing Cached Content:**
You can directly edit the generated markdown files to fine-tune your resume content:

```bash
# Edit the tailored markdown content
code logs/4c32e01e/tailored-a1b2c3d4.md

# After editing, regenerate the PDF with your changes
job-extractor resume "4c32e01e" my-cv.txt
# 📋 Using cached tailored content for job 4c32e01e (with your edits)
```

### Automatic Logging

All extracted job data is automatically saved to:
```
logs/job-{8-char-hash}-{timestamp}.json
```

Example: `logs/job-a1b2c3d4-2024-06-19T15-30-45-123Z.json`

Job scores are saved separately:
```
logs/score-{job-id}-{timestamp}.json  
```

Example: `logs/score-a1b2c3d4-2024-06-19T15-35-22-456Z.json`

Generated resumes are saved as:
```
logs/resume-{job-id}-{timestamp}.pdf
```

Example: `logs/resume-a1b2c3d4-2024-06-19T15-40-33-789Z.pdf`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is required"**
   - Make sure you've created a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key

2. **"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable is required"**
   - Make sure you've added your Anthropic API key to the `.env` file
   - Get your Anthropic API key from the Anthropic Console

3. **Network/fetch errors**
   - Some websites may block automated requests
   - Try with different URLs or check your internet connection

4. **Parsing errors**
   - The AI may occasionally struggle with unusual page layouts
   - Try with more standard job posting formats

5. **"Failed to parse critique response" errors**
   - Claude occasionally returns natural language instead of JSON
   - The system automatically attempts to extract JSON from the response
   - If issues persist, try running the critique command again

6. **Node.js Fetch API warnings**
   - `(node:XXXX) ExperimentalWarning: The Fetch API is an experimental feature`
