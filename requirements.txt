# Evaluation and testing dependencies
langsmith>=0.1.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0  # For loading .env files in evaluation scripts

# Optional: Pin to specific versions for reproducibility
# langsmith==0.1.17
# python-dotenv==1.0.0

# Note: langsmith is the primary evaluation framework for this project
# It provides comprehensive LLM evaluation, monitoring, and tracing capabilities

# Additional evaluation dependencies (optional)
openai>=1.0.0  # For custom evaluation scripts

# Note: openai-evals has complex TensorFlow dependencies that may conflict
# For most evaluation needs, langsmith is sufficient and recommended
# 
# If you need openai-evals specifically, install in a separate virtual environment

# Note: Use a virtual environment to install these dependencies
# See setup instructions in README.md
