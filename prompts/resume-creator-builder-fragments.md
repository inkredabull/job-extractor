## BUILDER MODE FRAGMENTS

### modeSpecificInstructions
- Reorder and emphasize relevant hands-on technical experience, deliverables, and shipped products
- Highlight built systems, coded solutions, deployed features, and measurable technical impact before leadership activities
- Be sure to include metrics to quantify product performance, delivery speed, technical scope, and business impact

### summaryGuidance
Tailor the summary to the job description, including as much of the following points as can be organically incorporated:
- hands-on software builder and technical problem-solver who ships end-user-facing products quickly
- strong at architecting, coding, optimizing, and deploying solutions while collaborating cross-functionally
- capable of leading when needed, but focused on building and delivering value

### rolesSpecificInstructions
Do not revise titles of roles; keep as-is.

### metricsType
**technical**

### bulletPointGuidance
At least half of the bullets for each role must describe hands-on technical work before any leadership accomplishments.
**Use action verbs that emphasize building and delivery** â€” examples: built, coded, implemented, architected, shipped, deployed, designed, optimized, refactored, automated, integrated, developed, configured, tested, debugged.  
Avoid leadership-centric verbs unless the job description explicitly requires them.

### verbReplacementSection
**Automatic Replacement Rule with Substitution Table:**  
When creating bullet points, if a bullet begins with a leadership-centric verb from the table below and the job description does not explicitly require that term, automatically replace it with the most contextually appropriate builder-centric verb from the table. Maintain factual accuracy while re-framing the action as hands-on technical contribution.

| Leadership-Centric Verb | Preferred Builder-Centric Replacement | Notes |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------|
| led                     | built / implemented / developed       | "built" for tangible products/features, "implemented" for processes/tooling, "developed" for code/systems |
| managed                 | developed / shipped / maintained      | Choose based on whether outcome was product delivery, feature release, or system upkeep |
| oversaw                 | architected / optimized / executed    | "Architected" for design work, "optimized" for performance improvements, "executed" for delivery |
| directed                | engineered / created / delivered      | "Engineered" for technical builds, "created" for new features, "delivered" for final outcomes |
| coordinated             | integrated / deployed / configured    | Use "integrated" for connecting systems, "deployed" for release, "configured" for setup work |
| supervised              | designed / automated / implemented    | Emphasize technical contribution over oversight |
| spearheaded             | shipped / launched / implemented      | Choose based on whether outcome was a launch, release, or build |
| guided                  | refactored / enhanced / tested        | Select based on actual technical work done |
| facilitated             | built / configured / optimized        | Ensure technical framing is preserved |

### technologiesSection
If a role involved significant hands-on coding or architecture work, include a "Technologies:" line selectively for each role, highlighting relevant languages, frameworks, cloud platforms, and tools.  
If it is included, do not make the line in italics.  Bold "Technologies:" but not the rest of the line.
If it is not included, add a "Technologies:" line item under the Skills section and include relevant technologies.

### skillsSpecificInstructions
First bullet group must be **Technologies & Tools**, listing relevant languages, frameworks, and systems.

### enforcementSection
## Enforcement Step (Self-Check)

After drafting the resume, scan all bullet points and the summary.  
If any bullet or summary sentence begins with a leadership-centric verb from the table and the job description does not explicitly require that term, replace it with the correct builder-centric verb from the table.  
Re-read the output to ensure builder-first framing is consistent throughout before returning the JSON.
