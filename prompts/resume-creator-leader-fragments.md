### technologiesSection
If it makes sense to include a "Technologies:" line selectively for each role, include it, highlighting those that are relevant.
If it is included, do not make the line in italics.  Bold "Technologies:" but not the rest of the line.

**CRITICAL: Do NOT create a separate "TECHNOLOGIES" section at the end of the resume. All technologies should be:**
1. Listed per-role as "Technologies:" lines, OR
2. Incorporated into the Skills section

**Never create a standalone Technologies section after Skills. Technologies are already covered in Skills.**

### skillsSpecificInstructions
Separate skills with bullet points.
