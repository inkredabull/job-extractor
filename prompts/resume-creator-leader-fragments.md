## LEADER MODE FRAGMENTS

### modeSpecificInstructions
- Reorder and emphasize relevant experience and skills
- Highlight relevant achievements and projects
- Be sure to include metrics to quantify team size, project scope, and business impact

### summaryGuidance
Tailor the summary to the job description, including as much of the following points as can be organically incorporated:
- hands-on, end-user-facing engineering leader as player/coach who builds and ships products
- scales teams collaboratively and cross-functionally while staying technical
- **IMPORTANT:** If the CV shows leadership experience, include team scale in the summary (e.g., "Led teams of 5-15 engineers", "Scaled engineering organization from X to Y")

### rolesSpecificInstructions
**CRITICAL for leadership roles:** The overview paragraph for each role MUST include team leadership metrics when applicable:
- Team size: "Led team of X engineers" or "Managed X-person engineering organization"
- Team composition: "including Y senior engineers, Z staff engineers" or "across N teams"
- Reporting structure: "managed X engineering managers and Y individual contributors"
- Team growth: "scaled team from X to Y engineers"

If the CV shows leadership responsibilities, these metrics are MANDATORY in the overview, not optional.

### metricsType
team leadership (team size, composition, reporting structure) and business impact

### bulletPointGuidance
For leadership roles, ensure bullets demonstrate both technical delivery AND team leadership:
- At least 1-2 bullets per role should reference team activities (hiring, mentoring, process improvement, cross-functional collaboration)
- Use phrases like: "Led team of X engineers to...", "Mentored senior engineers on...", "Built hiring pipeline resulting in..."
- Balance between "I delivered" (technical contributions) and "Led team to deliver" (leadership impact)


### verbReplacementSection


### technologiesSection
If it makes sense to include a "Technologies:" line selectively for each role, include it, highlighting those that are relevant.
If it is included, do not make the line in italics.  Bold "Technologies:" but not the rest of the line.

**CRITICAL: Do NOT create a separate "TECHNOLOGIES" section at the end of the resume. All technologies should be:**
1. Listed per-role as "Technologies:" lines, OR
2. Incorporated into the Skills section

**Never create a standalone Technologies section after Skills. Technologies are already covered in Skills.**

### skillsSpecificInstructions
Separate skills with bullet points.
