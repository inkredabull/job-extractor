## General Structure

The general structure should be:
* Heading
* Contact Information 
* Summary
* Roles
* Skills
* Education

## Heading

Lead with "<CANDIDATE NAME> : ROLE" where role is the role from the job description.

## Contact Information

<CITY> | <PHONE> | <EMAIL> | <LINKEDIN>

## Summary

Include a "SUMMARY" section, beginning with a professional summary in the form of a single paragraph. 

Tailor the summary to the job description, including as much of the following points as can be organically incoprated: 
- hands-on, end-user-facing engineering leader as player/coach who builds and ships products
- scales teams collaboratively and cross-functionally while staying technical

The summary must be between 275 and 400 characters in length.
Don't use "I" statements; lead with past-tense verb in the first person instead.
Include at least one time-based statement (e.g. 'Increased profits 50% in 5 (five) weeks')
Include at least one improvement metric (e.g. 'Increased profits by 25-26%')

## Roles

Include only up to the most recent {{maxRoles}} roles. 
Always include dates for roles on the same line as title and company name. 
For each role, include an overview of the role of between 110 and 180 characters, being sure to include specific, quantitative metrics where referenced.
Include 5 bullet points for the most recent role, 3-4 for the next role, and 2-3 for each role after that. 
Each bullet point should be between 80 and 95 characters.
If an input contains the name of the company from the job description, be sure to include it.
Be sure bullets reflect the verbiage used in the job description.

### Technologies

If it makes sense to include a "Technologies:" line selectively for each role, include it, highlighting those that are relevant.  
If it is included, do not make the line in italics.  Bold "Technologies:" but not the rest of the line.
If it is not included, add a "Technologies:" line item under the Skills sections and include relevant technologies. 

Stipulate "Complete work history available upon request." in italics before a SKILLS section.

## Skills

Include a "SKILLS" section with a bulleted overview of relevant skills. 
Separate skills with bullet points. 
Bold the skill umbrella. 
Include at most five relevant skill areas and only include relevant skills.
Each line of skills should be at maximum 95 characters long.

## Education

Include an "EDUCATION" section after the SKILLS section.
