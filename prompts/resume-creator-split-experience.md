## Roles - RELEVANT vs RELATED Format

Analyze and categorize all roles from the CV into two distinct sections based on alignment with the target position:

### RELEVANT EXPERIENCE

Include roles that directly align with the target position's core requirements. Select roles that:
- Demonstrate primary skills/technologies mentioned in the job description
- Show similar scope of responsibility and impact
- Reflect comparable or higher seniority level
- Represent the career trajectory leading to this position

**Total: 3-5 roles maximum for RELEVANT EXPERIENCE**

**CRITICAL: Roles MUST be listed in strict reverse-chronological order (most recent first). Sort by end date.**

For each relevant role:
- Include dates on the same line as title and company name
- Add a blank line after the title/dates line
- Include role overview (175-225 characters) with specific quantitative {{metricsType}} metrics
- Add a blank line after the overview
- Include 4-5 bullet points for the most recent role, 3-4 for subsequent relevant roles
- Each bullet point should be between 75 and 90 characters
- **CRITICAL: Each bullet point must be on its own line starting with a dash (-). Do NOT inline bullets.**

### RELATED EXPERIENCE

Include roles that provide supporting context but aren't direct matches. These may include:
- Adjacent skills or complementary technologies
- Different scope but demonstrates relevant capabilities (e.g., IC work when applying for leadership, or vice versa)
- Earlier career roles showing career progression and foundational skills
- Roles demonstrating transferable skills valuable to the position

**Total: 2-3 roles maximum for RELATED EXPERIENCE**

**CRITICAL: Roles MUST be listed in strict reverse-chronological order (most recent first). Sort by end date.**

For each related role:
- Include dates on the same line as title and company name
- Add a blank line after the title/dates line
- Include brief overview (100-150 characters) focusing on transferable value
- Add a blank line after the overview
- Include 1-2 bullet points per role highlighting most relevant achievements
- Each bullet point should be between 75 and 90 characters
- **CRITICAL: Each bullet point must be on its own line starting with a dash (-). Do NOT inline bullets.**

### Pagination Requirements

**CRITICAL PAGE LAYOUT:**
- Page 1 MUST contain: Header, Contact Info, Summary, RELEVANT EXPERIENCE section, Skills
- Page 2 SHOULD contain: RELATED EXPERIENCE section (if included), Education
- Adjust role count and bullet point density to ensure RELEVANT EXPERIENCE fits on page 1
- If RELEVANT EXPERIENCE threatens to spill to page 2, reduce to 3 roles with 3 bullets each

### Section Headers

Use "RELEVANT EXPERIENCE" and "RELATED EXPERIENCE" as the exact section headers in bold.

The distinction between RELEVANT and RELATED should be clear and defensible based on the job requirements. When in doubt about categorization, favor including a role in RELEVANT if it demonstrates core competencies mentioned in the job description.
