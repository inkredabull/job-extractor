## Roles - RELEVANT vs RELATED Format

**🚨 ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINT: MAXIMUM 2 PAGES 🚨**
The final resume must NEVER exceed 2 pages. If content approaches this limit, aggressively reduce bullet points and role count as specified in the Pagination Requirements section below.

Analyze and categorize all roles from the CV into two distinct sections based on alignment with the target position:

### RELEVANT EXPERIENCE

Include roles that directly align with the target position's core requirements. Select roles that:
- Demonstrate primary skills/technologies mentioned in the job description
- Show similar scope of responsibility and impact
- Reflect comparable or higher seniority level
- Represent the career trajectory leading to this position

**Total: 3-5 roles maximum for RELEVANT EXPERIENCE**

**CRITICAL: Roles MUST be listed in strict reverse-chronological order (most recent first). Sort by end date.**

For each relevant role:
- Include dates on the same line as title and company name
- Add a blank line after the title/dates line
- Include role overview (175-225 characters) with specific quantitative {{metricsType}} metrics
- Add a blank line after the overview
- **CRITICAL BULLET ALLOCATION (prioritize recency):**
  - Most recent role: 4-5 bullets
  - 2nd most recent: 3-4 bullets
  - 3rd role: 2-3 bullets
  - 4th+ roles: 1-2 bullets each
- Each bullet point should be between 75 and 90 characters
- **CRITICAL: Each bullet point must be on its own line starting with a dash (-). Do NOT inline bullets.**

### RELATED EXPERIENCE

Include roles that provide supporting context but aren't direct matches. These may include:
- Adjacent skills or complementary technologies
- Different scope but demonstrates relevant capabilities (e.g., IC work when applying for leadership, or vice versa)
- Earlier career roles showing career progression and foundational skills
- Roles demonstrating transferable skills valuable to the position

**Total: 2-3 roles maximum for RELATED EXPERIENCE**

**CRITICAL: Roles MUST be listed in strict reverse-chronological order (most recent first). Sort by end date.**

For each related role:
- Include dates on the same line as title and company name
- Add a blank line after the title/dates line
- Include brief overview (100-150 characters) focusing on transferable value
- Add a blank line after the overview
- Include 1-2 bullet points per role highlighting most relevant achievements
- Each bullet point should be between 75 and 90 characters
- **CRITICAL: Each bullet point must be on its own line starting with a dash (-). Do NOT inline bullets.**

### Pagination Requirements

**CRITICAL PAGE LAYOUT - MAXIMUM 2 PAGES:**
- **ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM: 2 pages total. Never exceed 2 pages.**
- Page 1 MUST contain: Header, Contact Info, Summary, RELEVANT EXPERIENCE section, Skills
- Page 2 MUST contain: RELATED EXPERIENCE section (if included), Education
- **If approaching 2-page limit:**
  - First, reduce oldest role bullets (4th+ roles to 1 bullet only)
  - Second, reduce RELATED roles to 1 bullet each
  - Third, remove lowest-relevance roles from RELATED section entirely
  - Fourth, reduce 3rd RELEVANT role to 2 bullets
  - Last resort: Limit to 3 RELEVANT roles with 4/3/2 bullet allocation

### Section Headers

Use "RELEVANT EXPERIENCE" and "RELATED EXPERIENCE" as the exact section headers in bold.

The distinction between RELEVANT and RELATED should be clear and defensible based on the job requirements. When in doubt about categorization, favor including a role in RELEVANT if it demonstrates core competencies mentioned in the job description.
