# Job Extractor Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension companion for the Job Extractor CLI tool that provides a right-side gutter panel for job application assistance.

## Features

- **Right Gutter Panel**: Opens at 33% of screen width on the right side
- **Hello World Display**: Shows welcome message and feature preview
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: `Ctrl+Shift+J` (or `Cmd+Shift+J` on Mac) to toggle the panel
- **Popup Control**: Click the extension icon to open/close the panel
